**Project Description**

This Streamlit web application designed to visualize and explore data related to Rwanda Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI is an important economic indicator that measures changes in the average prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services over time. The application allows users to interactively view, analyze, and understand CPI data in different ways.
